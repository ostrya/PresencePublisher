This free open-source app regularly publishes to a configurable MQTT topic whenever
connected to a given Wi-Fi network or in proximity to a Bluetooth beacon.
It can be used to integrate the presence of your phone in home automation.

The app uses the AndroidX WorkManager library, so notifications are sent
even if the phone is in stand-by. In addition to regularly scheduled checks,
the app also reacts to changes in the network connection.

The MQTT client supports anonymous and username / password authentication
as well as client certificate authentication. For more details on how to
configure certificate-based authentication, please have a look at
<a href="https://github.com/ostrya/PresencePublisher/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/ostrya/PresencePublisher/blob/main/README.md</a>.

Note that the data you choose to publish is sent only to the server of your choice.
The app does not send any data to me or any other third party.

If you want to know more about how this app processes your location data,
