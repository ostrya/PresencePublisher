This app regularly publishes to a configurable MQTT topic whenever
connected to a given WiFi network. It can be used to integrate the presence
of your phone in home automation.

The app uses the built-in Android alarm manager, so notifications are sent
even if the phone is in stand-by. In addition to regularly scheduled checks,
the app also reacts to changes in the network connection.

In addition to anonymous and username / password authentication, client certificate
authentication is also supported. For more details, please have a look at
