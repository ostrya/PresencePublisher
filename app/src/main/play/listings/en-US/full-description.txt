This free open-source app regularly publishes to a configurable MQTT topic whenever
connected to a given WiFi network or in proximity to a Bluetooth beacon.
It can be used to integrate the presence of your phone in home automation.

The app uses the built-in Android alarm manager, so notifications are sent
even if the phone is in stand-by. In addition to regularly scheduled checks,
the app also reacts to changes in the network connection.

The MQTT client supports anonymous and username / password authentication
as well ass client certificate authentication. For more details on how to
configure certificate-based authentication, please have a look at
https://github.com/ostrya/PresencePublisher/blob/master/README.md .
